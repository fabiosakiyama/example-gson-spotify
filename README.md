## AppWithoutSpotifyApi
Given an artist name, the App searchs it's id, then it's albums, 
and for each song of each album, returns the most popular song from that artist.

## AppWithSpotifyApi
Given an artist name, the App searchs it's id, then it's albums, 
and for each song of each album, returns:

- Saddest album
The measure is only using spotify valence, not so accurate.
